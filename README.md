# Employee-Attrition-Prediction
## Overview:
This project builds an ML model to accurately predict employee attrition using data like HR records and surveys. Key steps include data cleaning, analysis, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. The aim is to help companies retain employees by predicting turnover efficiently.

## Tools and Technologies Used:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Project Tasks:
• Data Collection: Collect employee data from various sources such as HR records, employee surveys, and performance evaluations.
• Data Preprocessing: Perform data cleaning, feature selection, feature engineering, and data transformation to prepare the dataset for analysis.
• Exploratory Data Analysis: Use visualization techniques to explore the data and identify any trends, patterns, or relationships between the variables.
• Feature Selection: Identify the most significant features that contribute to employee attrition and eliminate any irrelevant or redundant features.
• Model Selection: Select a suitable machine learning algorithm for the prediction task, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines.
• Model Training: Train the selected machine learning algorithm on the preprocessed dataset and optimize the model’s hyperparameters to improve its performance.
• Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Expected Outcome:
The expected outcome of this project is a machine learning model that can accurately predict employee attrition based on the input features. The model’s performance can be evaluated using various metrics, and it can be deployed in a production environment to assist employers in retaining their employees and improving their workforce.
